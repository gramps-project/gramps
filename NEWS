  process death events.
* Fix graphdoc to properly escape characters in ids for Graphviz.

* Narrative web fix:
  - some strings not translated
  - The confidence and the date are not translated in the family map page.
  - The date doesn't use the specified date format.
  - Markers incorrectly placed.  In the map pages, the markers are not placed
    where it should be. Reproducible when zoom in/zoom out.
  - Background not correctly set.  If you use the Web_Basic-Cypress.css,
    the foreground and background use the same color, so you see nothing.
    You must hover the fields to see the text
  - Places list is not sorted depending on the selected language.  If you
    start gramps in english or another language then try to generate a
    narrative web report in another language, the navigation alphabet is
    incorrect. This is true for the place list and the person list.
  - OSM forward all http resquest to https.
  - When we are on a mobile phone or a small device, we suppress the
    navigation tab.  In place, we have a new icon on the upper left
    which is used to show the dropdown menu.
  - For Home, Introduction and Contact, If we have an image and this image
    contains regions, show the regions. We can go directly to the person page
    associated to this region.  If we click on the image, we go directly to
    the associated media page. This will be true only if we selected
    "include images and media objects" and "create and only use thumbnail"
    is unselected
  - The first line identifying a family will be more legible.
