** restructure the families index so families are indexed under both spouses, and the family name is normalised
** separate out Families section in individual and families pages so individual page links to the family page and family page links to both people
** normalise links to families so the link is only displayed if the family page is present, and the gid is included when appropriate
** remove highlighting of media subregions except in the media pages (it was confusing and not very well implemented)
** include people whose surname is absent in the individual, surname and families indexes
** html_escape names and surnames
** always display media thumbnails for first image in Gallery list (in some cases they were suppressed if they had been displayed at the top of the page)

** Included repository reference media type and call number in the 'Repositories' section of the relevant source instead of the Repository page.
** Implemented a generalised back reference function to display the 'References' section of all pages. This recursively displays references till one is found for which a page exists.
** Removed list of people and families from heading of the event pages as these are now in the 'References' section.
** Fixed bug "0005968: Narrated Web Site not copying Source Citations files such as jpg or pdf docs to web site
** Fixed bug "0005946 GRAMPS failed to insert jpeg image into proper place for an event" by displaying a thumbnail for citation media in the 'Source References' section (with a link to the media page)

** Tidy up sources pages - fix numbering of repositories, remove unused parameters, fix title of individual source pages
** Bug: reset NarrWeb navigation menu layout when style sheet doesn't support it
** Change Source Pages to use the list of sources generated by the first pass that finds objects to be output, and simplify references section on the Source page to use the references passed to it.
** Fix option to suppress Gramps ID (bug #6237)
* a number of technical changes to Narrative Web
** Removed a lot of redundant code and parameters (mainly connected with the old way of determining the objects to be included in the report).
** Movement of some large chunks of code within the source file and some initial work towards GEPS 022: Narrative Website Refactor. Functionality should be unchanged. 
** Moved routines for calculating objects to be output so they can be part of default list building classes.
* Various updated translations: da, de, es, fr, it, nb, nl, pt_BR, pt_PT, sv, uk

    be hidden.

    tree with 30000 people previously took 4 seconds on a 1.4GHz PC running
    Gramps 3.1, but now takes milliseconds.
