  generations between the two people.

  LaunchServices it doesn't have a sys.stderr attached so the default stream

  the local variable short_name not being declared before it comes time to
  process death events.
* Fix graphdoc to properly escape characters in ids for Graphviz.
* Replace inspect.stack() with inspect.currentframe().
  Works around https://bugs.python.org/issue12920 which causes every
  call to inspect.trace() to fail because __main__ is always the

  Gramps
* Narrative web fix:
  - some strings not translated
  - The confidence and the date are not translated in the family map page.
  - The date doesn't use the specified date format.
  - Markers incorrectly placed.  In the map pages, the markers are not placed
    where it should be. Reproducible when zoom in/zoom out.
  - Background not correctly set.  If you use the Web_Basic-Cypress.css,
    the foreground and background use the same color, so you see nothing.
    You must hover the fields to see the text
  - Places list is not sorted depending on the selected language.  If you
    start gramps in english or another language then try to generate a
    narrative web report in another language, the navigation alphabet is
    incorrect. This is true for the place list and the person list.
  - OSM forward all http resquest to https.
  - When we are on a mobile phone or a small device, we suppress the
    navigation tab.  In place, we have a new icon on the upper left
    which is used to show the dropdown menu.
  - For Home, Introduction and Contact, If we have an image and this image
    contains regions, show the regions. We can go directly to the person page
    associated to this region.  If we click on the image, we go directly to
    the associated media page. This will be true only if we selected
    "include images and media objects" and "create and only use thumbnail"
    is unselected
  - The first line identifying a family will be more legible.
    The link is not useful in the parents and pedigree section for the
    current person.

  - extrapage can now point to joomla, drupal, ...
  - add enclosed by and encloses (place)
  - Add compact Ancestry trees using Buchheim/Walker algorithm
    This enhancement adds a new 'compact' field to the Narrated Web Report.
    A compact tree is one that is not a simple binary layout but uses the
    algorithm of Buchheim/Walker to create a layout that is sensible but also
    compact.  Creating a compact layout is slower than a simple binary tree
    but the results are significantly improved and do not leave large areas
    of whitespace where there are no nodes to be shown.
  - Make relationships optional in narrative web
  - Option to have Places and Sources pages
  - Narrative should come first right after the name, gender and parent
    information in individual page
  - References section at the bottom of each place with people related to this
    place have birth year behind it in parenthesis

* Person Sidebarfilter:
  - Fix Person Sidebarfilter when using 'Event' and Reg expressions
  - In personsidebarfilter, search on each part of name Instead of requiring
    that the entire search string matches a single one of the Person's names,
    the function will require that each word in the search string matches any
    of the Person's name fields.
* filters rule has attribute: Check all values of an attribute type and not
  only the first one.
* filters rule have children person filter: Check all families of a person
  for children and not only the first
* Graph reports:
  - Better typography in graph reports Replace hyphen with en-dash.
  - enable Graphviz node port selection, optionable. This enables the
    headport and tailport attributes for all edges in the Graphviz file.
    The default (off) value makes the arrows between persons and/or family
    nodes attach their ends to the respective node at any position. When this
    option is selected, the position facing the node on the other side of the
    arrow is always chosen.
  - Fix graphs on Windows for font selection not working
* relationship graph:
  - Allow an option to not use hexagons for those of unknown gender
  - Father and Mother are connected by an invisible line.
  - Add an option to omit "irrelevant" family nodes
* Family lines graph: Replace rounded corners checkbox by dropdown
  It now allows rounded corners to be set more explicitly for different
  genders (None/Male/Female/Both).

  - Add Ahnentafel option on hourglass
  - Do not use hyphen for living persons in hourglass graph
* edit link: Add a mailto choice to Internet Address

  This tool is looking for people and place names with leading or/and trailing
  spaces.  For each entry which contains leading or trailing spaces, a row is
  added in a table.  You can see where the spaces are for each row as the name
  is underlined.  If you double click on the row, you can edit the Place or
  the Person.
* CSV import: Add occupation and residence events and attributes in the import
  User can now add the following columns in the csv import file for a person:
  - Occupation description
  - Occupation date
  - Occupation place
  - Occupation source
  - Residence date
  - Residence place

** separate out Families section in individual and families pages so individual page links to the family page and family page links to both people
** normalise links to families so the link is only displayed if the family page is present, and the gid is included when appropriate
** remove highlighting of media subregions except in the media pages (it was confusing and not very well implemented)
** include people whose surname is absent in the individual, surname and families indexes
** html_escape names and surnames
** always display media thumbnails for first image in Gallery list (in some cases they were suppressed if they had been displayed at the top of the page)

** Included repository reference media type and call number in the 'Repositories' section of the relevant source instead of the Repository page.
** Implemented a generalised back reference function to display the 'References' section of all pages. This recursively displays references till one is found for which a page exists.
** Removed list of people and families from heading of the event pages as these are now in the 'References' section.
** Fixed bug "0005968: Narrated Web Site not copying Source Citations files such as jpg or pdf docs to web site
** Fixed bug "0005946 GRAMPS failed to insert jpeg image into proper place for an event" by displaying a thumbnail for citation media in the 'Source References' section (with a link to the media page)

** Tidy up sources pages - fix numbering of repositories, remove unused parameters, fix title of individual source pages
** Bug: reset NarrWeb navigation menu layout when style sheet doesn't support it
** Change Source Pages to use the list of sources generated by the first pass that finds objects to be output, and simplify references section on the Source page to use the references passed to it.
** Fix option to suppress Gramps ID (bug #6237)
* a number of technical changes to Narrative Web
** Removed a lot of redundant code and parameters (mainly connected with the old way of determining the objects to be included in the report).
** Movement of some large chunks of code within the source file and some initial work towards GEPS 022: Narrative Website Refactor. Functionality should be unchanged.
** Moved routines for calculating objects to be output so they can be part of default list building classes.
