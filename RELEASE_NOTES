UNSTABLE Gramps 4.0.0 Beta2 release.

This is a technology preview to allow distribution packagers (and plugin
writers) to update their scripts (and plugins). This release is not
production ready, so only use it for testing!

It is recommended that Gramps 4.0.0 be used with python 2.7 since many
dependent packages do not yet have python 3 versions.  A determined person
can probably download their sources and build them, however.

The dependencies for Gramps 4.0.0 are _completely_ different than 3.4 due 
to the switch to GObject introspection, and the removal of autotools. So 
only install 4.0.0 if you are certain you can obtain the dependencies, 
see README and INSTALL. 

For linux, in Ubuntu 12.10 you can install 4.0.0, but you will need to 
compile and install osmgpsmap manually to have the maps working (see 
https://www.gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=GEPS_029:_GTK3-GObject_introspection_Conversion#OsmGpsMap_for_GeographyÂ )
