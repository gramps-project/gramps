* Replace the LPRDoc interface (based on gnome-print) with a GTK based
  print routine. This would remove one of the last gnome-specific 
  libraries, and make portability better. Even more important, the 
  gnome-print interface has been deprecated by the GNOME project, so it
  will not be around forever. We need to adapt to the new GTK method.

* Add support for formatted notes. We have a start by ripping off code
  from GPL code from grecipe-manager.

* Allow for multiple notes. A tabbed interface would be really useful,
  since there are no titles for notes. Not all objects would
  necessarily need multiple notes. Determine which ones should and
  shouldn't.

* Split views

* Export to spreadsheet, print, CSV of views - DONE

* Date calculator.  See
  http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=3252078&forum_id=1993

* Add string substitutions for web page generation (name, report name,
  date, etc).

* Add support for sources of the parent/child relation

* Add support for storing reliability (confidence) of the marriage
  information; see
  http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=3066997&forum_id=1993
  and
  http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=3134931&forum_id=1993
  for the details.

* Move LDS temple info out of const.py and into an XML file

* Make the descendant graph adapt to the page size, not stuck with the
  current 3 entries per page.

* Add slideshow generation ability to web page generator

* And a whole lot more....
