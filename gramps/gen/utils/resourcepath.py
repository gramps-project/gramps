class ResourcePath:
    """
    ResourcePath is a singleton, meaning that only one of them is ever
    created.  At startup it finds the paths to Gramps's resource files and
    caches them for future use.

    It should be called only by const.py; other code should retrieve the
    paths from there.

    Attempt to derive the resource path from the package path assuming that
    one of the three main installation schemes has been used.

    The package path will be one of the following:

    <prefix>/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages
    <prefix>\\Lib\\site-packages

    <home>/lib/python

    <userbase>/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages
    <userbase>\\PythonXY\\site-packages

    Where <prefix>, <home> and <userbase> are the resource paths used in the
    Prefix, Home and User installation schemes.

    The use of the command line option "--install-data" in the setup script
    is no longer supported.
