**Introduction**

Gramps is divided into two parts. The database code, that does not
require any particular GUI libraries, and the gtk-based UI code
that requires gtk and gnome libraries. The gtk-based code can use
the gobject signal support to manage callback signals but the database
code can not.

The module provides a subset of the signal mechanisms that are available
from the gobject framework. It enables the database code to use signals
to communicate events to any callback methods in either the database code
or the UI code.

    Callback and signal support objects.

    **Declaring signals**

    Classes that want to emit signals need to inherit from the
    DBCallback class and ensure that its :meth:`__init__` method
    is called. They then need to declare the signals that they
    can emit and the types of each callbacks arguments. For
    example::

        class TestSignals(Callback):

            __signals__ = {
                      'test-signal' : (int, ),
                      'test-noarg'  : None
                     }

            def __init__(self):
                Callback.__init__(self)

    The type signature is a tuple of types or classes. The type
    checking code uses the isinstance method to check that the
    argument passed to the emit call is an instance of the type
    in the signature declaration.

    If the signal does not have an argument use None as the
    signature.

    The signals will be inherited by any subclasses. Duplicate
    signal names in subclasses are not alowed.


    **Emitting signals**

    Signals are emitted using the emit method. e.g.::

            def emit_signal(self):
                self.emit('test-signal', (1, ))

    The parameters are passed as a tuple so a single parameter
    must be passed as a 1 element tuple.

    **Connecting callbacks to signals**

    Attaching a callback to the signals is similar to the gtk
    connect methods. e.g.::

        # connect to a function.
        def fn(i):
            print 'got signal value = ', i

        t = TestSignals()
        t.connect('test-signal', fn)

        # connect to a bound method
        class C:

            def cb_func(self, i):
                print 'got class signal = ', 1

        r = R()
        t.connect('test-signal', r.cb_func)


    **Disconnecting callbacks**

    If you want to disconnect a callback from a signals you must remember the
    key returned from the connect call. This key can be passed to the disconnect
    method to remove the callback from the signals callback list.

    e.g.::

        t = TestSignals()

        # connect to a bound method
        class C:

            def cb_func(self, i):
                print 'got class signal = ', 1

        r = R()
        key = t.connect('test-signal', r.cb_func)

        ...

        t.disconnect(key)


    **Stopping and starting signals**

    Signals can be blocked on a per instance bassis or they can be blocked
    for all instances of the Callback class. :meth:`disable_signals` can
    be used to block the signals for a single instance and
    :meth:`disable_all_signals` can be used to block signals for the class:

    e.g.::


           class TestSignals(Callback):

            __signals__ = {
                      'test-signal' : (int, ),
                      'test-noarg'  : None
                     }

            def __init__(self):
                Callback.__init__(self)

            def emit_signal(self):
                self.emit('test-signal', (1, ))

            t = TestSignals()

            # block signals from instance t
            t.disable_signals()

            ...

            # unblock
            t.enable_signals()

            # block all signals
            Callback.disable_all_signals()

            ...

            # unblock all signals
            Callback.enable_all_signals()


    Any signals emitted whilst signals are blocked will be lost.


    **Debugging signal callbacks**


    To help with debugging the signals and callbacks you can turn on
    lots of logging information. To switch on logging for a single
    instance call :meth:`enable_logging`, to switch it off again call
    :meth:`disable_logging`. To switch on logging for all instance
    you can toggle Callback.__LOG_ALL to True.
