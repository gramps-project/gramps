    It is designed to be a singleton.  The menu portion of this is responsible
    only for Gramps main window menus and toolbar.
    This was implemented to extend Gtk.Builder functions to allow editing
    (merging) of the original builder XML with additional XML fragments during
    operations.  This allows changing of the menus and toolbar when the tree is
    loaded, views are changed etc.

    The ActionGroup portions can also be used by other windows.  Other windows
    needing menus or toolbars can create them via Gtk.Builder.
    """

        """
        @param app: Gramps Gtk.Application reference
        @type app: Gtk.Application
        @param initial_xml: Initial (primary) XML string for Gramps menus and
            toolbar
        @type changexml: string

        The xml is basically Gtk Builder xml, in particular the various menu
        and toolbar elements.  It is possible to add other elements as well.
        The xml this supports has been extended in two ways;
        1) there is an added "groups=" attribute to elements.  This
           attribute associates the element with one or more named ActionGroups
           for making the element visible or not.  If 'groups' is missing, the
           element will be shown as long as enclosing elements are shown.  The
           element will be shown if the group is present and considered visible
           by the uimanager.  If more than one group is needed, they should be
           separated by a space.
        2) there is an added <placeholder> tag supported; this is used to mark
           a place where merged UI XML can be inserted.  During the update_menu
           processing, elements enclosed in this tag pair are promoted to the
           level of the placeholder tag, and the placeholder tag is removed.

        Note that any elements can be merged (replaced) by the
        add_ui_from_string method, not just placeholders.  This works by
        matching the "id=" attribute on the element, and replacing the
        original element with the one from the add method.

        Note that when added elements are removed by the remove_ui method, they
        are replaced by the containing xml (with the 'id=') only, so don't put
        anything inside of the containing xml to start with as it will be lost
        during editing.
