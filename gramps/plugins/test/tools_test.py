        Run a 'Test Case Generator' and 'Check & Repair Database' test.
        Note that the 'Test Case Generator" uses a lot of random numbers to
        generate its test cases.  This makes it less than ideal for a
        predictable unit test.  Still it contains good code for testing the
        'Check and Repair' tool.  So I force the random functions to be
        predictable by seeding it with a fixed number.  I also used the
        'Deterministic ID' function to make the usual db handle generation
        stop using random numbers and potentially reduce Gramps version to
        version issues.
