# Key is the language (or language and country), Value is a list of

# The comment below from the glibc locale sv_SE in
# localedata/locales/sv_SE :
#
# % The letter w is normally not present in the Swedish alphabet. It
# % exists in some names in Swedish and foreign words, but is accounted
# % for as a variant of 'v'.  Words and names with 'w' are in Swedish
# % ordered alphabetically among the words and names with 'v'. If two
# % words or names are only to be distinguished by 'v' or % 'w', 'v' is
# % placed before 'w'.
#
# See : https://www.gramps-project.org/bugs/view.php?id = 2933
#

# HOWEVER: the characters V and W in Swedish are not considered as a special
# case for several reasons. (1) The default collation for Swedish (called the
# 'reformed' collation type) regards the difference between 'v' and 'w' as a
# primary difference. (2) 'v' and 'w' in the 'standard' (non-default) collation
# type are not a contraction, just a case where the difference is secondary
# rather than primary. (3) There are plenty of other languages where a
# difference that is primary in other languages is secondary, and those are not
# specially handled.
