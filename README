Documentation
---------------------------------
The User Manual is now maintained, built and installed using gnome-doc-utils.
Please see the documentation for the gnome-doc-utils package to learn
how this works.

Current HTML documentation can also be found on the gramps website,
http://www.gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=User_manual



Building on non-Linux systems: i18n support and GNU make
--------------------------------------------------------
If make fails, use gmake (the name FreeBSD gives to GNU make) instead.
You might need a patch also. FreeBSD has in ports a patch (  /usr/ports/science/gramps/files)
you need to apply to po/Makefile.in.in
