                    Be careful, webkit is always in a development phase.
                    If you get crashes, remove python-webkit and add the
                    gecko package instead.
   or
   python-gtkmozembed is the gecko equivalent to webkit which is more stable.
                    It can be python-gnome2-extras or python-gtkhtml2

Documentation
---------------------------------
The User Manual is now maintained on the gramps website,
http://www.gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=User_manual
We might in the future distribute again a manual via gnome-doc-utils, this has not
been decided yet though.


Building on non-Linux systems: i18n support and GNU make
--------------------------------------------------------
If make fails, use gmake (the name FreeBSD gives to GNU make) instead.
You might need a patch also. FreeBSD has in ports a patch (  /usr/ports/science/gramps/files)
you need to apply to po/Makefile.in.in
