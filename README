                    xx your language code eg for Dutch you need
                    language-pack-gnome-nl. The translation of the
                    Gramps strings is included with the source code.


The following packages are *STRONGLY RECOMMENDED* to be installed:
   osmgpsmap        Used to show maps in the geography view. 
                    Without this the GeoView will not be active, see
                    http://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=Gramps_3.3_Wiki_Manual_-_Main_Window#Geography_Category
                    The package is named osmgpsmap, osm-gps-map
                    or python-osmgpsmap. Or obtain it from: http://nzjrs.github.com/osm-gps-map/
   GraphViz         Enable creation of graphs using GraphViz engine.
                    Without this no beautiful graphs can be created.

                    A html renderer must be installed to use the view.
                    !! PACKAGERS, Test if on your distribution
                    webkit and Gramps is stable. If you obtain crashes, patch

Documentation
---------------------------------
The User Manual is now maintained on the gramps website,
http://www.gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=User_manual
We might in the future distribute again a manual via gnome-doc-utils, this has not
been decided yet though.


Building on non-Linux systems: i18n support and GNU make
--------------------------------------------------------
If make fails, use gmake (the name FreeBSD gives to GNU make) instead.
You might need a patch also. FreeBSD has in ports a patch (  /usr/ports/science/gramps/files)
you need to apply to po/Makefile.in.in
