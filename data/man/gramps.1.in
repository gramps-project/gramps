.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP 
\fIGramps\fP is a Free/OpenSource genealogy program. It is written in Python, 
using the GTK+/GNOME interface.
Gramps should seem familiar to anyone who has used other genealogy programs 
before such as \fIFamily Tree Maker (TM)\fR,  \fIPersonal Ancestral
Files (TM)\fR, or the GNU Geneweb.
It supports importing of the ever popular GEDCOM format which is used world 
wide by almost all other genealogy software.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 
.BI gramps " FILE" 
When \fIFILE\fR is given (without any flags) as a family tree name or as
a family tree database directory, then it is opened and an interactive 
session is started. If FILE is a file format understood by GRAMPS, an empty
family tree is created  whose name is based on the \fIFILE\fP name
and the data is imported into it. The rest of the
options is ignored. This way of launching is suitable for using gramps
as a handler for genealogical data in e.g. web browsers. This invocation
can accept any data format native to gramps, see below.
.br

.TP 
.BI \-f,\-\^\-format= " FORMAT"
Explicitly specify format of \fIFILE\fR given by preceding
.ig
\fB\-O\fR,
..
\fB\-i\fR, or 
\fB\-e\fR option. If the \fB\-f\fR option is not given for any \fIFILE\fR, 
the format of that file is guessed according to its extension or MIME-type. 
.br

Formats 
available for export are \fBgramps\-xml\fR (guessed if \fIFILE\fR ends with
\fB.gramps\fR), \fBgedcom\fR (guessed if \fIFILE\fR ends with \fB.ged\fR), or
any file export available through the GRAMPS plugin system.
.br

Formats 
available for import are \fBgrdb\fR, \fBgramps\-xml\fR, \fBgedcom\fR,  
\fBgramps\-pkg\fR (guessed if \fIFILE\fR ends with \fB.gpkg\fR), and
\fBgeneweb\fR (guessed if \fIFILE\fR ends with \fB.gw\fR). 
.br

Formats available for export are
.ig
\fBgrdb\fR,
..
\fBgramps\-xml\fR, \fBgedcom\fR,
\fBgramps\-pkg\fR, \fBwft\fR (guessed if \fIFILE\fR ends with \fB.wft\fR),
\fBgeneweb\fR, and \fBiso\fR (never guessed, always specify with
\fB\-f\fR option).

.TP 
.BI \-l
Print a list of known family trees.

.TP
.BI \-u,\-\^\-force-unlock
Unlock a locked database.

.TP 
.BI \-O,\-\^\-open= " DATABASE"
Open \fIDATABASE\fR which must be an existing database directory or existing family tree name.
If no action, import or export options are given on the command line then an interactive session is started using that database.

.TP 
.BI \-i,\-\^\-import= " FILE"
Import data from \fIFILE\fR. If you haven't specified a database then a temporary database is used; this is deleted when you exit gramps.
.br

When more than one input file is given, each has to be preceded by \fB\-i\fR 
flag. The files are imported in the specified order, 
i.e. \fB\-i\fR \fIFILE1\fR \fB\-i\fR \fIFILE2\fR  
and \fB\-i\fR \fIFILE2\fR \fB\-i\fR \fIFILE1\fR might produce different 
gramps IDs in the resulting database. 

.TP 
.BI \-a,\-\^\-action= " ACTION"
Perform \fIACTION\fR on the imported data. This is done after all imports
are successfully completed. Currently available actions are 
\fBsummary\fR (same as Reports->View->Summary), 
\fBcheck\fR (same as Tools->Database Processing->Check and Repair), 
\fBreport\fR (generates report), and
\fBtool\fR (runs a plugin tool).
Both \fBreport\fR and \fBtool\fR need the \fIOPTIONSTRING\fR supplied by the 
\fB\-p\fR flag). 
.br

The \fIOPTIONSTRING\fR should satisfy the following conditions:
.br
It must not contain any spaces. 
If some arguments need to include spaces, the string should
be enclosed with quotation marks, i.e., follow the shell syntax.
Option string is a list of pairs with name and value (separated by the 
equality sign). The name and value pairs must be separated by commas.  
.br

Most of the report or tools options are specific for each report or tool. 
However, there are some common options.

.BI "name=name"
.br
This mandatory option determines which report or tool will be run.
If the supplied \fIname\fR does not correspond to any available report or 
tool, an error message will be printed followed by the list of
available reports or tools (depending on the \fIACTION\fR).

.BI "show=all"
.br
This will produce the list of names for all options available for a given 
report or tool.

.BI "show="optionname
.br
This will print the description of
the functionality supplied by \fIoptionname\fR, as well as what are the
acceptable types and values for this option.

.br
Use the above options to find out
everything about a given report.  

.LP
When more than one output action is given, each has to be preceded 
by \fB\-a\fR flag. The actions are performed one by one, in the specified order.

.TP 
.BI \-d,\-\^\-debug= " LOGGER_NAME"
Enables debug logs for development and testing. Look at the source code for details
.TP
.BI \-\^\-version
Prints the version number of gramps and then exits
\" change 0 to 1 to enable output of OAF options
.if 0 \{
.PP
The following options are used for Bonobo activation.
.TP 
.BI \-\^\-oaf-ior-fd= "FD"
File descriptor to print the OAF IOR on
.TP 
.BI \-\^\-oaf-activate-iid= " IID"
OAF IID to activate
.TP 
.BI \-\^\-oaf-private
Prevent registering of server with OAF
\}
\" change 0 to 1 to enable output of Gnome sound options
.if 0 \{
.PP
The following options are used for controlling sound using the Gnome Library.
.TP
.BI \-\^\-disable-sound
Disable sound server usage
.TP
.BI \-\^\-enable-sound
Enable sound server usage
.TP
.BI \-\^\-espeaker= " HOSTNAME:PORT"
Host:port on which the sound server to use is running
\}

.SH "Operation"
.br
If the first argument on the command line does not start with dash (i.e. no
flag), gramps will attempt to open the file with the name given by the first
argument and start interactive session, ignoring the rest of the command line
arguments.

.LP
If the \fB\-O\fR flag is given, then gramps will try opening
the supplied database and then work with that data, as instructed by the
further command line parameters.

.LP
With or without the \fB\-O\fR flag, there could be multiple imports,
exports, and actions specified further on the command line by using \fB\-i\fR,
\fB\-e\fR, and \fB\-a\fR flags.  

.LP
The order of \fB\-i\fR, \fB\-e\fR, or \fB\-a\fR options does not matter. The
actual order always is: all imports (if any) -> all actions (if any)
-> all exports (if any). But opening must always be first!

.LP
If no \fB\-O\fR or \fB\-i\fR option is given, gramps will launch its main 
window and start the usual interactive session with the empty database,
since there is no data to process, anyway.

.LP
If no \fB\-e\fR or \fB\-a\fR options are given, gramps will launch its main 
window and start the usual interactive session with the database resulted 
from all imports. This database resides in the \fBimport_db.grdb\fR
under \fB~/.gramps/import\fR directory.

.LP
The error encountered during import, export, or action, will be either 
dumped to \fIstdout\fR (if these are exceptions handled by gramps) or 
to \fIstderr\fR (if these are not handled). Use usual shell redirections 
of \fIstdout\fR and \fIstderr\fR to save messages and errors in files. 

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP 
To open an existing family tree and import an xml file  into it, one may type: 
\fBgramps\fR \fB\-O\fR \fI'My Family Tree'\fR \fB\-i\fR \fI~/db3.gramps\fR
.TP 
The above changes the opened family tree, to do the same, but import both in a temporary family tree and start an interactive session, one may type: 
\fBgramps\fR \fB\-i\fR \fI'My Family Tree'\fR \fB\-i\fR \fI~/db3.gramps\fR
.TP 
To import four databases (whose formats can be determined from their names) and then check the resulting database for errors, one may type: 
\fBgramps\fR \fB\-i\fR \fIfile1.ged\fR \fB\-i\fR \fIfile2.tgz\fR \fB\-i\fR \fI~/db3.gramps\fR \fB\-i\fR \fIfile4.wft\fR \fB\-a\fR \fIcheck\fR 
.TP 
To explicitly specify the formats in the above example, append filenames with appropriate \fB\-f\fR options: 
\fBgramps\fR \fB\-i\fR \fIfile1.ged\fR \fB\-f\fR \fIgedcom\fR \fB\-i\fR \fIfile2.tgz\fR \fB\-f\fR \fIgramps-pkg\fR \fB\-i\fR \fI~/db3.gramps\fR \fB\-f\fR \fIgramps-xml\fR \fB\-i\fR \fIfile4.wft\fR \fB\-f\fR \fIwft\fR  \fB\-a\fR \fIcheck\fR 
.TP 
To record the database resulting from all imports, supply \fB\-e\fR flag (use \fB\-f\fR if the filename does not allow gramps to guess the format):
\fBgramps\fR \fB\-i\fR \fIfile1.ged\fR \fB\-i\fR \fIfile2.tgz\fR \fB\-e\fR \fI~/new-package\fR \fB\-f\fR \fIgramps-pkg\fR 
.TP 
To import three databases and start interactive gramps session with the result: 
\fBgramps\fR \fB\-i\fR \fIfile1.ged\fR \fB\-i\fR \fIfile2.tgz\fR \fB\-i\fR \fI~/db3.gramps\fR 
.TP 
To run the Verify tool from the commandline and output the result to stdout: 
\fBgramps\fR \fB\-O\fR \fI'My Family Tree'\fR \fB-a\fR \fItool\fR \fB-p\fR \fBname\fR=\fIverify\fR
.TP 
Finally, to start normal interactive session type: 
\fBgramps\fR 

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The program checks whether these environment variables are set:

\fBLANG\fR - describe, which language to use:
Ex.: for polish language this variable has to be set to pl_PL.UTF-8.

\fBGRAMPSHOME\fR - if set, force GRAMPS to use the specified directory to keep 
program settings and databases there. By default, this variable is not set and 
gramps assumes that the folder with all databases and profile settings 
should be created within the user profile folder (described by environment 
variable HOME for Linux or USERPROFILE for Windows 2000/XP).

.SH CONCEPTS
Supports a python\-based plugin system, allowing import and export writers, 
report generators, tools, and display filters to be added without modification 
of the main program.
.LP 
In addition to generating direct printer output, report generators also 
target other systems, such as \fIOpenOffice.org\fR, \fIAbiWord\fR, HTML, 
or LaTeX to allow the users to modify the format to suit their needs.
