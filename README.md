We strive to produce a genealogy program that is both intuitive for hobbyists and feature-complete for professional genealogists.

Please read the [**COPYING**](https://github.com/gramps-project/gramps/blob/maintenance/gramps52/COPYING) file first.

Please read the [**INSTALL**](https://github.com/gramps-project/gramps/blob/maintenance/gramps52/INSTALL) file if you intend to build from source.

Requirements
============
The following packages **MUST** be installed in order for Gramps to work:

* [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) 3.9 or greater - The programming language used by Gramps.
* [**GTK**](http://www.gtk.org/) 3.24 or greater - A cross-platform widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces.
* [**pygobject**](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/PyGObject) 3.12 or greater - Python Bindings for GLib/GObject/GIO/GTK+

The following three packages with GObject Introspection bindings (the gi packages)

* [**cairo**](http://cairographics.org/) 1.14.0 or greater - a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output devices.
* [**Pycairo**](https://github.com/pygobject/pycairo) 1.13.3 or greater - GObject Introspection bindings for cairo.
* [**pango**](http://www.pango.org/) - a library for laying out and rendering of text, with an emphasis on internationalization.
* [**pangocairo**](http://www.pango.org/) - Allows you to use Pango with Cairo.
* [**librsvg2**](http://live.gnome.org/LibRsvg) - (SVG icon view) a library to render SVG files using cairo.
* [**bsddb3**](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bsddb3/) - Python bindings for Oracle Berkeley database.
* [**sqlite3**](https://www.sqlite.org/) - Python bindings for SQLite Database library.

The following package is needed for full translation of the interface
to your language:

*   **language-pack-gnome-xx**

 Translation of GTK elements to your language, with
 xx your language code; e.g. for Dutch you need
 language-pack-gnome-nl. The translation of the
 Gramps strings is included with the Gramps source.


The following packages are **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED** to be installed:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
*  [**orjson**](https://pypi.org/project/orjson/)

  A fast JSON library for Python. Used to increase the performance of Gramps.
  The package name is usually orjson, python-orjson or python3-orjson.

*  [**osmgpsmap**](https://nzjrs.github.io/osm-gps-map/)

 Used to show maps in the [Geography Category](https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=Gramps_5.1_Wiki_Manual_-_Categories#Geography_Category).
 It may be osmgpsmap, osm-gps-map, or python-osmgpsmap,
 but the Python bindings for this must also be present, so gir1.2-osmgpsmap-1.0.
 Without this the GeoView will not be active.

* [**Graphviz**](http://www.graphviz.org)

  Enable creation of graphs using Graphviz engine.
  Without this, three reports cannot be run.
  The package name is usually graphviz or python3-pygraphviz.

* [**PyICU**](http://pyicu.osafoundation.org/)

 Improves localised sorting in Gramps. In particular, this
 applies to sorting in the various views and in the
 Narrative Web output. It is particularly helpful for
 non-Latin characters, for non-English locales and on MS
 Windows and Mac OS X platforms. If it is not available,
 sorting is done through built-in libraries. PyICU is
 fairly widely available through the package managers of
 distributions.
 (These are Python bindings for the ICU package
 https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyICU/).

* [**Ghostscript**](https://www.ghostscript.com)

  Used by Graphviz reports to help create PDF files.

* [**python-imagesize**](https://pypi.org/project/imagesize/)

 Provides better image processing performance. If this module is not available,
 we continue to use Gdk. This provides a real improvement when we need to
 process many big images.


The following packages are optional:
------------------------------------
* **gspell**

 Enable spell checking in the notes.

* [**rcs**](https://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/)

 The GNU Revision Control System (RCS) can be used to
 [archive a family tree](https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=Gramps_5.1_Wiki_Manual_-_Manage_Family_Trees#Archiving_a_Family_Tree).
 Multiple revisions of your family trees can be managed.
 Only rcs is needed, NO python bindings are required.

* [**Pillow**](https://python-pillow.org)

 The friendly Python Image Library fork is needed to crop
 images and also to convert non-JPG images to
 JPG so as to include them in LaTeX output.
 The package name is usually python-pillow or python3-pillow.

* [**gexiv2**](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/gexiv2) 0.5 or greater

 Enables Gramps to manage Exif metadata embedded in your
 media.

* [**ttf-freefont**](https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/freefont/)

 Provides genealogical symbols and more fonts for reports

* **geocode-glib**

 A library use to associate a geographical position (latitude, longitude)
 to a place name. This is used if you already have osmgpsmap installed.
 If installed, when you add or link a place from the map, you have a red line
 at the end of the table for selection.
 The package name is usually gir1.2-geocodeglib-1.0 or geocode-glib.

* [**fontconfig**](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fontconfig/)

 Python bindings of fontconfig are required for displaying
 genealogical symbols

* [**pycountry**](https://pypi.org/project/pycountry/)

 Used to validate ISO language codes.


Optional packages required by Third-party Addons
------------------------------------------------

**[Third-party Addons](https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=Third-party_Plugins) are written by users and developers and unless stated are not officially part of Gramps.**

Prerequistes required for the following Addons to work:
