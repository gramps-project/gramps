"<b>Working with Dates</b><br/>A range of dates can be given by using the "
"format &quot;between January 4, 2000 and March 20, 2003&quot;. You can also "
"indicate the level of confidence in a date and even choose between seven "
"different calendars. Try the button next to the date field in the Events "
"Editor."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:2
msgid ""
"<b>Editing Objects</b><br/>In most cases double clicking on a name, source, "
"place or media entry will bring up a window to allow you to edit the object. "
"Note that the result can be dependent on context. For example, in the Family "
"View clicking on a parent or child will bring up the Relationship Editor."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:3
msgid ""
"<b>Adding Images</b><br/>An image can be added to any gallery or the Media "
"View by dragging and dropping it from a file manager or a web browser. "
"Actually you can add any type of file like this, useful for scans of "
"documents and other digital sources."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:4
msgid ""
"<b>Ordering Children in a Family</b><br/>The birth order of children in a "
"family can be set by using drag and drop. This order is preserved even when "
"they do not have birth dates."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:5
msgid ""
"<b>Talk to Relatives Before It Is Too Late</b><br/>Your oldest relatives can "
"be your most important source of information. They usually know things about "
"the family that haven't been written down. They might tell you nuggets about "
"people that may one day lead to a new avenue of research. At the very least, "
"you will get to hear some great stories. Don't forget to record the "
"conversations!"
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:6
msgid ""
"<b>Filtering People</b><br/>In the People View, you can 'filter' individuals "
"based on many criteria. To define a new filter go to &quot;Edit &gt; Person "
"Filter Editor&quot;. There you can name your filter and add and combine "
"rules using the many preset rules. For example, you can define a filter to "
"find all adopted people in the family tree. People without a birth date "
"mentioned can also be filtered. To get the results save your filter and "
"select it at the bottom of the Filter Sidebar, then click Apply. If the "
"Filter Sidebar is not visible, select View &gt; Filter."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:7
msgid ""
"<b>Inverted Filtering</b><br/>Filters can easily be reversed by using the "
"'invert' option. For instance, by inverting the 'People with children' "
"filter you can select all people without children."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:8
msgid ""
"<b>Locating People</b><br/>By default, each surname in the People View is "
"listed only once. By clicking on the arrow to the left of a name, the list "
"will expand to show all individuals with that last name. To locate any "
"Family Name from a long list, select a Family Name (not a person) and start "
"typing. The view will jump to the first Family Name matching the letters you "
"enter."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:9
msgid ""
"<b>The Family View</b><br/>The Family View is used to display a typical "
"family unit as two parents and their children."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:10
msgid ""
"<b>Changing the Active Person</b><br/>Changing the Active Person in views is "
"easy. In the Relationship view just click on anyone. In the Ancestry View "
"doubleclick on the person or right click to select any of their spouses, "
"siblings, children or parents."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:11
msgid ""
"<b>Who Was Born When?</b><br/>Under &quot;Tools &gt; Analysis and "
"exploration &gt; Compare Individual Events...&quot; you can compare the data "
"of individuals in your database. This is useful, say, if you wish to list "
"the birth dates of everyone in your database. You can use a custom filter to "
"narrow the results."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:12
msgid ""
"<b>Gramps Tools</b><br/>Gramps comes with a rich set of tools. These allow "
"you to undertake operations such as checking the database for errors and "
"consistency. There are research and analysis tools such as event comparison, "
"finding duplicate people, interactive descendant browser, and many others. "
"All tools can be accessed through the &quot;Tools&quot; menu."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:13
msgid ""
"<b>Calculating Relationships</b><br/>To check if two people in the database "
"are related (by blood, not marriage) try the tool under &quot;Tools &gt; "
"Utilities &gt; Relationship Calculator...&quot;. The exact relationship as "
"well as all common ancestors are reported."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:14
msgid ""
"<b>SoundEx can help with family research</b><br/>SoundEx solves a long "
"standing problem in genealogy, how to handle spelling variations. The "
"SoundEx Gramplet takes a surname and generates a simplified form that is "
"equivalent for similar sounding names. Knowing the SoundEx Code for a "
"surname is very helpful for researching Census Data files (microfiche) at a "
"library or other research facility. To view the SoundEx codes for surnames "
"in your database, add the SoundEx Gramplet."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:15

"<b>Setting Your Preferences</b><br/>&quot;Edit &gt; Preferences...&quot; "
"lets you modify a number of settings, such as the path to your media files, "

"needs. Each separate view can also be configured under &quot;View &gt; "
"Configure View...&quot;"
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:16
msgid ""
"<b>Gramps Reports</b><br/>Gramps offers a wide variety of reports. The "
"Graphical Reports and Graphs can present complex relationships easily and "
"the Text Reports are particularly useful if you want to send the results of "
"your family tree to members of the family via email. If you're ready to make "
"a website for your family tree then there's a report for that as well."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:17
msgid ""
"<b>Starting a New Family Tree</b><br/>A good way to start a new family tree "
"is to enter all the members of the family into the database using the Person "
"View (use &quot;Edit &gt; Add...&quot; or click on the Add a new person "
"button from the People View). Then go to the Relationship View and create "
"relationships between people."

"<b>What's That For?</b><br/>Unsure what a button does? Simply hold the mouse "
"over a button and a tooltip will appear."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:19
msgid ""
"<b>Unsure of a Date?</b><br/>If you're unsure about the date an event "
"occurred, Gramps allows you to enter a wide range of date formats based on a "
"guess or an estimate. For instance, &quot;about 1908&quot; is a valid entry "
"for a birth date in Gramps. Click the Date button next to the date field and "
"see the Gramps Manual to learn more."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:20
msgid ""
"<b>Duplicate Entries</b><br/>&quot;Tools &gt; Database Processing &gt; Find "
"Possible Duplicate People...&quot; allows you to locate (and merge) entries "
"of the same person entered more than once in the database."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:21
msgid ""
"<b>Merging Entries</b><br/>The function &quot;Edit &gt; Compare and Merge..."
"&quot; allows you to combine separately listed people into one. Select the "
"second entry by holding the Control key as you click. This is very useful "
"for combining two databases with overlapping people, or combining "
"erroneously entered differing names for one individual. This also works for "
"the Places, Sources and Repositories views."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:22
msgid ""
"<b>Organising the Views</b><br/>Many of the views can present your data as "
"either a hierarchical tree or as a simple list. Each view can also be "
"configured to the way you like it. Have a look to the right of the top "
"toolbar or under the &quot;View&quot; menu."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:23
msgid ""
"<b>Navigating Back and Forward</b><br/>Gramps maintains a list of previous "
"active objects such as People and Events. You can move forward and backward "
"through the list using &quot;Go &gt; Forward&quot; and &quot;Go &gt; "
"Back&quot; or the arrow buttons."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:24
msgid ""
"<b>Keyboard Shortcuts</b><br/>Tired of having to take your hand off the "
"keyboard to use the mouse? Many functions in Gramps have keyboard shortcuts. "
"If one exists for a function it is displayed on the right side of the menu."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:25
msgid ""
"<b>Read the Manual</b><br/>Don't forget to read the Gramps manual, &quot;"
"Help &gt; User Manual&quot;. The developers have worked hard to make most "
"operations intuitive but the manual is full of information that will make "
"your time spent on genealogy more productive."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:26
msgid ""
"<b>Adding Children</b><br/>To add children in Gramps there are two options. "
"You can find one of their parents in the Families View and open the family. "
"Then choose to create a new person or add an existing person. You can also "
"add children (or siblings) from inside the Family Editor."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:27
msgid ""
"<b>Editing the Parent-Child Relationship</b><br/> You can edit the "
"relationship of a child to its parents by double clicking the child in the "
"Family Editor. Relationships can be any of Adopted, Birth, Foster, None, "
"Sponsored, Stepchild and Unknown."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:28
msgid ""
"<b>Show All Checkbutton</b><br/>When adding an existing person as a spouse, "
"the list of people shown is filtered to display only people who could "
"realistically fit the role (based on dates in the database). In case Gramps "
"is wrong in making this choice, you can override the filter by checking the "
"Show All checkbutton."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:29
msgid ""
"<b>Improving Gramps</b><br/>Users are encouraged to request enhancements to "
"Gramps. Requesting an enhancement can be done either through the gramps-"

"\n"
"1. To import four databases (whose formats can be determined from their "
"names)\n"
"and then check the resulting database for errors, one may type:\n"
"gramps -i file1.ged -i file2.gpkg -i ~/db3.gramps -i file4.wft -a tool -p "
"name=check.\n"
"\n"
"2. To explicitly specify the formats in the above example, append filenames "
"with appropriate -f options:\n"
"gramps -i file1.ged -f gedcom -i file2.gpkg -f gramps-pkg -i ~/db3.gramps -f "
"gramps-xml -i file4.wft -f wft -a tool -p name=check.\n"
"\n"
"3. To record the database resulting from all imports, supply -e flag\n"
"(use -f if the filename does not allow Gramps to guess the format):\n"
"gramps -i file1.ged -i file2.gpkg -e ~/new-package -f gramps-pkg\n"
"\n"
"4. To save any error messages of the above example into files outfile and "
"errfile, run:\n"
"gramps -i file1.ged -i file2.dpkg -e ~/new-package -f gramps-pkg >outfile "
"2>errfile\n"
"\n"
"5. To import three databases and start interactive Gramps session with the "
"result:\n"
"gramps -i file1.ged -i file2.gpkg -i ~/db3.gramps\n"
"\n"
"6. To open a database and, based on that data, generate timeline report in "
"PDF format\n"
"putting the output into the my_timeline.pdf file:\n"
"gramps -O 'Family Tree 1' -a report -p name=timeline,off=pdf,of=my_timeline."
"pdf\n"
"\n"
"7. To generate a summary of a database:\n"
"gramps -O 'Family Tree 1' -a report -p name=summary\n"
"\n"
"8. Listing report options\n"
"Use the name=timeline,show=all to find out about all available options for "
"the timeline report.\n"
"To find out details of a particular option, use show=option_name , e.g. "
"name=timeline,show=off string.\n"
"To learn about available report names, use name=show string.\n"
"\n"
"9. To convert a Family Tree on the fly to a .gramps xml file:\n"
"gramps -O 'Family Tree 1' -e output.gramps -f gramps-xml\n"
"\n"
"10. To generate a web site into an other locale (in german):\n"
"LANGUAGE=de_DE; LANG=de_DE.UTF-8 gramps -O 'Family Tree 1' -a report -p "
