msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:5
msgid "<b>Talk to Relatives Before It Is Too Late</b><br/>Your oldest relatives can be your most important source of information. They usually know things about the family that haven't been written down. They might tell you nuggets about people that may one day lead to a new avenue of research. At the very least, you will get to hear some great stories. Don't forget to record the conversations!"
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:6
msgid "<b>Filtering People</b><br/>In the People View, you can 'filter' individuals based on many criteria. To define a new filter go to &quot;Edit &gt; Person Filter Editor&quot;. There you can name your filter and add and combine rules using the many preset rules. For example, you can define a filter to find all adopted people in the family tree. People without a birth date mentioned can also be filtered. To get the results save your filter and select it at the bottom of the Filter Sidebar, then click Apply. If the Filter Sidebar is not visible, select View &gt; Filter."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:7

msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:11
msgid "<b>Who Was Born When?</b><br/>Under &quot;Tools &gt; Analysis and exploration &gt; Compare Individual Events...&quot; you can compare the data of individuals in your database. This is useful, say, if you wish to list the birth dates of everyone in your database. You can use a custom filter to narrow the results."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:12
msgid "<b>Gramps Tools</b><br/>Gramps comes with a rich set of tools. These allow you to undertake operations such as checking the database for errors and consistency. There are research and analysis tools such as event comparison, finding duplicate people, interactive descendant browser, and many others. All tools can be accessed through the &quot;Tools&quot; menu."

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:13
msgid "<b>Calculating Relationships</b><br/>To check if two people in the database are related (by blood, not marriage) try the tool under &quot;Tools &gt; Utilities &gt; Relationship Calculator...&quot;. The exact relationship as well as all common ancestors are reported."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:14
msgid "<b>SoundEx can help with family research</b><br/>SoundEx solves a long standing problem in genealogy, how to handle spelling variations. The SoundEx utility takes a surname and generates a simplified form that is equivalent for similar sounding names. Knowing the SoundEx Code for a surname is very helpful for researching Census Data files (microfiche) at a library or other research facility. To get the SoundEx codes for surnames in your database, go to &quot;Tools &gt; Utilities &gt; Generate SoundEx Codes...&quot;."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:15
msgid "<b>Setting Your Preferences</b><br/>&quot;Edit &gt; Preferences...&quot; lets you modify a number of settings, such as the path to your media files, and allows you to adjust many aspects of the Gramps presentation to your needs. Each separate view can also be configured under &quot;View &gt; Configure View...&quot;"

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:16
msgid "<b>Gramps Reports</b><br/>Gramps offers a wide variety of reports. The Graphical Reports and Graphs can present complex relationships easily and the Text Reports are particularly useful if you want to send the results of your family tree to members of the family via email. If you're ready to make a website for your family tree then there's a report for that as well."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:17
msgid "<b>Starting a New Family Tree</b><br/>A good way to start a new family tree is to enter all the members of the family into the database using the Person View (use &quot;Edit &gt; Add...&quot; or click on the Add a new person button from the People View). Then go to the Relationship View and create relationships between people."

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:19
msgid "<b>Unsure of a Date?</b><br/>If you're unsure about the date an event occurred, Gramps allows you to enter a wide range of date formats based on a guess or an estimate. For instance, &quot;about 1908&quot; is a valid entry for a birth date in Gramps. Click the Date button next to the date field and see the Gramps Manual to learn more."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:20
msgid "<b>Duplicate Entries</b><br/>&quot;Tools &gt; Database Processing &gt; Find Possible Duplicate People...&quot; allows you to locate (and merge) entries of the same person entered more than once in the database."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:21
msgid "<b>Merging Entries</b><br/>The function &quot;Edit &gt; Compare and Merge...&quot; allows you to combine separately listed people into one. Select the second entry by holding the Control key as you click. This is very useful for combining two databases with overlapping people, or combining erroneously entered differing names for one individual. This also works for the Places, Sources and Repositories views."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:22
msgid "<b>Organising the Views</b><br/>Many of the views can present your data as either a hierarchical tree or as a simple list. Each view can also be configured to the way you like it. Have a look to the right of the top toolbar or under the &quot;View&quot; menu."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:23
msgid "<b>Navigating Back and Forward</b><br/>Gramps maintains a list of previous active objects such as People, Events and . You can move forward and backward through the list using &quot;Go &gt; Forward&quot; and &quot;Go &gt; Back&quot; or the arrow buttons."

msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:25
msgid "<b>Read the Manual</b><br/>Don't forget to read the Gramps manual, &quot;Help &gt; User Manual&quot;. The developers have worked hard to make most operations intuitive but the manual is full of information that will make your time spent on genealogy more productive."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:26
msgid "<b>Adding Children</b><br/>To add children in Gramps there are two options. You can find one of their parents in the Families View and open the family. Then choose to create a new person or add an existing person. You can also add children (or siblings) from inside the Family Editor."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:27
msgid "<b>Editing the Parent-Child Relationship</b><br/> You can edit the relationship of a child to its parents by double clicking the child in the Family Editor. Relationships can be any of Adopted, Birth, Foster, None, Sponsored, Stepchild and Unknown."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:28
msgid "<b>Show All Checkbutton</b><br/>When adding an existing person as a spouse, the list of people shown is filtered to display only people who could realistically fit the role (based on dates in the database). In case Gramps is wrong in making this choice, you can override the filter by checking the Show All checkbutton."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml.in.h:29
msgid "<b>Improving Gramps</b><br/>Users are encouraged to request enhancements to Gramps. Requesting an enhancement can be done either through the gramps-users or gramps-devel mailing lists, or by going to http://bugs.gramps-project.org and creating a Feature Request.

"Example of usage of Gramps command line interface\n"
"\n"
"1. To import four databases (whose formats can be determined from their names)\n"
"and then check the resulting database for errors, one may type:\n"
"gramps -i file1.ged -i file2.gpkg -i ~/db3.gramps -i file4.wft -a tool -p name=check. \n"
"\n"
"2. To explicitly specify the formats in the above example, append filenames with appropriate -f options:\n"
"gramps -i file1.ged -f gedcom -i file2.gpkg -f gramps-pkg -i ~/db3.gramps -f gramps-xml -i file4.wft -f wft -a tool -p name=check. \n"
"\n"
"3. To record the database resulting from all imports, supply -e flag\n"
"(use -f if the filename does not allow Gramps to guess the format):\n"
"gramps -i file1.ged -i file2.gpkg -e ~/new-package -f gramps-pkg\n"
"\n"
"4. To save any error messages of the above example into files outfile and errfile, run:\n"
"gramps -i file1.ged -i file2.dpkg -e ~/new-package -f gramps-pkg >outfile 2>errfile\n"
"\n"
"5. To import three databases and start interactive Gramps session with the result:\n"
"gramps -i file1.ged -i file2.gpkg -i ~/db3.gramps\n"
"\n"
"6. To open a database and, based on that data, generate timeline report in PDF format\n"
"putting the output into the my_timeline.pdf file:\n"
"gramps -O 'Family Tree 1' -a report -p name=timeline,off=pdf,of=my_timeline.pdf\n"
"\n"
"7. To generate a summary of a database:\n"
"gramps -O 'Family Tree 1' -a report -p name=summary\n"
"\n"
"8. Listing report options\n"
"Use the name=timeline,show=all to find out about all available options for the timeline report.\n"
"To find out details of a particular option, use show=option_name , e.g. name=timeline,show=off string.\n"
"To learn about available report names, use name=show string.\n"
"\n"
"9. To convert a Family Tree on the fly to a .gramps xml file:\n"
"gramps -O 'Family Tree 1' -e output.gramps -f gramps-xml\n"
"\n"
"10. To generate a web site into an other locale (in german):\n"
"LANGUAGE=de_DE; LANG=de_DE.UTF-8 gramps -O 'Family Tree 1' -a report -p name=navwebpage,target=/../de\n"
"\n"
"11. Finally, to start normal interactive session type:\n"
"gramps\n"
"\n"
"Note: These examples are for bash shell.\n"
"Syntax may be different for other shells and for Windows.\n"
