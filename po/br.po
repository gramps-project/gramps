"<b>Working with Dates</b><br/>A range of dates can be given by using the "

"the level of confidence in a date and even choose between seven different "
"calendars. Try the button next to the date field in the Events Editor."

msgid ""
"<b>Editing Objects</b><br/>In most cases double clicking on a name, source, "
"place or media entry will bring up a window to allow you to edit the object. "
"Note that the result can be dependent on context. For example, in the Family "
"View clicking on a parent or child will bring up the Relationship Editor."

#: ../data/tips.xml:8
msgid ""
"<b>Adding Images</b><br/>An image can be added to any gallery or the Media "

"family can be set by using drag and drop. This order is preserved even when "
"they do not have birth dates."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:12
msgid ""
"<b>Talk to Relatives Before It Is Too Late</b><br/>Your oldest relatives can "
"be your most important source of information. They usually know things about "
"the family that haven't been written down. They might tell you nuggets about "
"people that may one day lead to a new avenue of research. At the very least, "
"you will get to hear some great stories. Don't forget to record the "
"conversations!"
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:14
msgid ""
"<b>Filtering People</b><br/>In the People View, you can 'filter' individuals "
"based on many criteria. To define a new filter go to \"Edit &gt; Person "
"Filter Editor\". There you can name your filter and add and combine rules "
"using the many preset rules. For example, you can define a filter to find "
"all adopted people in the family tree. People without a birth date mentioned "
"can also be filtered. To get the results save your filter. Then select this "
"filter in the Filter field on Sidebar, then click Find button. If the "
"Sidebar is not visible, select View &gt; Sidebar."

"<b>Gramps Tools</b><br/>Gramps comes with a rich set of tools. These allow "

msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:30
msgid ""
"<b>SoundEx can help with family research</b><br/>SoundEx solves a long "
"standing problem in genealogy, how to handle spelling variations. The "
"SoundEx Gramplet takes a surname and generates a simplified form that is "
"equivalent for similar sounding names. Knowing the SoundEx Code for a "
"surname is very helpful for researching Census Data files (microfiche) at a "
"library or other research facility. To view the SoundEx codes for surnames "

"<b>Gramps Reports</b><br/>Gramps offers a wide variety of reports. The "
"Graphical Reports and Graphs can present complex relationships easily and "

msgid ""
"<b>Merging Entries</b><br/>The function \"Edit &gt; Merge...\" allows you to "
"combine separately listed people into one. Select the second entry by "

"\n"
"1. To import four databases (whose formats can be determined from their "

"gramps -i file1.ged -i file2.gpkg -i ~/db3.gramps -i file4.wft -a tool -p "
