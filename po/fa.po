msgid ""
"<b>Working with Dates</b><br/>A range of dates can be given by using the "
"format \"between January 4, 2000 and March 20, 2003\". You can also indicate "
"the level of confidence in a date and even choose between seven different "
"calendars. Try the button next to the date field in the Events Editor."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:6
msgid ""
"<b>Editing Objects</b><br/>In most cases double clicking on a name, source, "
"place or media entry will bring up a window to allow you to edit the object. "
"Note that the result can be dependent on context. For example, in the Family "
"View clicking on a parent or child will bring up the Relationship Editor."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:8
msgid ""
"<b>Adding Images</b><br/>An image can be added to any gallery or the Media "
"View by dragging and dropping it from a file manager or a web browser. "

"documents and other digital sources."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:10
msgid ""
"<b>Ordering Children in a Family</b><br/>The birth order of children in a "
"family can be set by using drag and drop. This order is preserved even when "
"they do not have birth dates."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:12
msgid ""
"<b>Talk to Relatives Before It Is Too Late</b><br/>Your oldest relatives can "
"be your most important source of information. They usually know things about "
"the family that haven't been written down. They might tell you nuggets about "
"people that may one day lead to a new avenue of research. At the very least, "
"you will get to hear some great stories. Don't forget to record the "
"conversations!"
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:14
msgid ""
"<b>Filtering People</b><br/>In the People View, you can 'filter' individuals "
"based on many criteria. To define a new filter go to \"Edit &gt; Person "
"Filter Editor\". There you can name your filter and add and combine rules "
"using the many preset rules. For example, you can define a filter to find "
"all adopted people in the family tree. People without a birth date mentioned "
"can also be filtered. To get the results save your filter. Then select this "
"filter in the Filter field on Sidebar, then click Find button. If the "
"Sidebar is not visible, select View &gt; Sidebar."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:16
msgid ""
"<b>Inverted Filtering</b><br/>Filters can easily be reversed by using the "
"'invert' option \"Return values that do not match the filter rules\". For "
"instance, by inverting the 'People with children' filter you can select all "
"people without children."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:18
msgid ""
"<b>Locating People</b><br/>In the Grouped People View, each surname is "
"listed only once. By clicking on the arrow to the left of a name, the list "
"will expand to show all individuals with that last name. To locate any "

"typing. The view will jump to the first Family Name matching the letters you "
"enter."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:20

"family unit as two parents and their children."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:22
msgid ""
"<b>Changing the Active Person</b><br/>Changing the Active Person in views is "

#: ../data/tips.xml:24
msgid ""
"<b>Who Was Born When?</b><br/>Under \"Tools &gt; Analysis and exploration "
"&gt; Compare Individual Events...\" you can compare the data of individuals "
"in your database. This is useful, say, if you wish to list the birth dates "
"of everyone in your database. You can use a custom filter to narrow the "
"results."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:26
msgid ""
"<b>Gramps Tools</b><br/>Gramps comes with a rich set of tools. These allow "
"you to undertake operations such as checking the database for errors and "
"consistency. There are research and analysis tools such as event comparison, "
"finding duplicate people, interactive descendant browser, and many others. "
"All tools can be accessed through the \"Tools\" menu."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:28
msgid ""
"<b>Calculating Relationships</b><br/>To check if two people in the database "
"are related (by blood, not marriage) try the tool under \"Tools &gt; "
"Utilities &gt; Relationship Calculator...\". The exact relationship as well "
"as all common ancestors are reported."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:30
msgid ""
"<b>SoundEx can help with family research</b><br/>SoundEx solves a long "
"standing problem in genealogy, how to handle spelling variations. The "
"SoundEx Gramplet takes a surname and generates a simplified form that is "
"equivalent for similar sounding names. Knowing the SoundEx Code for a "
"surname is very helpful for researching Census Data files (microfiche) at a "
"library or other research facility. To view the SoundEx codes for surnames "
"in your database, add the SoundEx Gramplet."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:32
msgid ""
"<b>Setting Your Preferences</b><br/>\"Edit &gt; Preferences...\" lets you "

"Each separate view can also be configured under \"View &gt; Configure View..."
"\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:34
msgid ""
"<b>Gramps Reports</b><br/>Gramps offers a wide variety of reports. The "
"Graphical Reports and Graphs can present complex relationships easily and "
"the Text Reports are particularly useful if you want to send the results of "
"your family tree to members of the family via email. If you're ready to make "
"a website for your family tree then there's a report for that as well."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:36
msgid ""
"<b>Starting a New Family Tree</b><br/>A good way to start a new family tree "
"is to enter all the members of the family into the database using the Person "
"View (use \"Edit &gt; Add...\" or click on the Add a new person button from "
"the People View). Then go to the Relationship View and create relationships "
"between people."

"over a button and a tooltip will appear."

#: ../data/tips.xml:40
msgid ""
"<b>Unsure of a Date?</b><br/>If you're unsure about the date an event "
"occurred, Gramps allows you to enter a wide range of date formats based on a "
"guess or an estimate. For instance, \"about 1908\" is a valid entry for a "
"birth date in Gramps. Click the \"Invoke date editor\" button next to the "
"date field. See the Gramps Manual to learn more."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:42
msgid ""
"<b>Duplicate Entries</b><br/>The tool \"Tools &gt; Family Tree Processing "

"entries of the same person entered more than once in the database."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:44
msgid ""
"<b>Merging Entries</b><br/>The function \"Edit &gt; Merge...\" allows you to "
"combine separately listed people into one. Select the second entry by "
"holding the Control key as you click. This is very useful for combining two "
"databases with overlapping people, or combining erroneously entered "
"differing names for one individual. Merging is available in all list views "
"for all primary object types."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:46
msgid ""
"<b>Organising the Views</b><br/>Many of the views can present your data as "
"either a hierarchical tree or as a simple list. Each view can also be "
"configured to the way you like it. Have a look to the right of the top "
"toolbar or under the \"View\" menu."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:48
msgid ""
"<b>Navigating Back and Forward</b><br/>Gramps maintains a list of previous "

"buttons."

msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:52
msgid ""
"<b>Read the Manual</b><br/>Don't forget to read the Gramps manual, \"Help "
"&gt; User Manual\". The developers have worked hard to make most operations "
"intuitive but the manual is full of information that will make your time "
"spent on genealogy more productive."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:54
msgid ""
"<b>Adding Children</b><br/>To add children in Gramps there are two options. "
"You can find one of their parents in the Families View and open the family. "
"Then choose to create a new person or add an existing person. You can also "
"add children (or siblings) from inside the Family Editor."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:56
msgid ""
"<b>Editing the Parent-Child Relationship</b><br/> You can edit the "
"relationship of a child to its parents by double clicking the child in the "
"Family Editor. Relationships can be any of Adopted, Birth, Foster, None, "
"Sponsored, Stepchild and Unknown."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:58
msgid ""
"<b>Show All Checkbutton</b><br/>When adding an existing person as a spouse, "
"the list of people shown is filtered to display only people who could "
"realistically fit the role (based on dates in the database). In case Gramps "
"is wrong in making this choice, you can override the filter by checking the "
"Show All checkbutton."
msgstr ""

#: ../data/tips.xml:60
msgid ""
"<b>Improving Gramps</b><br/>Users are encouraged to request enhancements to "
"Gramps. Requesting an enhancement can be done either through the gramps-"

"original developer, Don Allingham, by his father. It stands for "

"<b>The GEDCOM File Format</b><br/>Gramps allows you to import from, and "
"export to, the GEDCOM format. There is extensive support for the industry "

"Example of usage of Gramps command line interface\n"
"\n"
"1. To import four databases (whose formats can be determined from their "
"names)\n"
"and then check the resulting database for errors, one may type:\n"
"gramps -i file1.ged -i file2.gpkg -i ~/db3.gramps -i file4.wft -a tool -p "
"name=check.\n"
"\n"
"2. To explicitly specify the formats in the above example, append filenames "
"with appropriate -f options:\n"
"gramps -i file1.ged -f gedcom -i file2.gpkg -f gramps-pkg -i ~/db3.gramps -f "
"gramps -i file4.wft -f wft -a tool -p name=check.\n"

"3. To record the database resulting from all imports, supply -e flag\n"
"(use -f if the filename does not allow Gramps to guess the format):\n"
"gramps -i file1.ged -i file2.gpkg -e ~/new-package -f gramps-pkg\n"

"errfile, run:\n"
"gramps -i file1.ged -i file2.dpkg -e ~/new-package -f gramps-pkg >outfile "
"2>errfile\n"

"5. To import three databases and start interactive Gramps session with the "
"result:\n"
"gramps -i file1.ged -i file2.gpkg -i ~/db3.gramps\n"

"putting the output into the my_timeline.pdf file:\n"
"gramps -O 'Family Tree 1' -a report -p name=timeline,off=pdf,of=my_timeline."

"7. To generate a summary of a database:\n"
"gramps -O 'Family Tree 1' -a report -p name=summary\n"
"\n"
"8. Listing report options\n"
"Use the name=timeline,show=all to find out about all available options for "
"the timeline report.\n"
"To find out details of a particular option, use show=option_name , e.g. "
"name=timeline,show=off string.\n"
"To learn about available report names, use name=show string.\n"
"\n"
"9. To convert a Family Tree on the fly to a .gramps xml file:\n"
"gramps -O 'Family Tree 1' -e output.gramps -f gramps\n"
"\n"
"10. To generate a web site into an other locale (in german):\n"
"LANGUAGE=de_DE; LANG=de_DE.UTF-8 gramps -O 'Family Tree 1' -a report -p "
"name=navwebpage,target=/../de\n"
